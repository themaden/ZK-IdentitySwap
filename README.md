## Features

- Private token swaps using zero-knowledge proofs
- Integration with Ethereum wallets
- User-friendly web interface
- Foundry for smart contract development
- Next.js frontend with TypeScript
- Noir for zkSNARK circuit development

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- Foundry
- Noir
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zk-identityswap.git
cd zk-identityswap


2.Install smart contract dependencies:
cd zk_identityswap_foundry
forge install

3.Install frontend dependencies:
cd ../zk-identity-ui
npm install


Development
Smart Contracts

cd zk_identityswap_foundry
forge test        # Run tests
forge build       # Compile contracts


Frontend

cd zk-identity-ui
npm run dev      # Start development server



Usage
1.Connect your wallet to the dApp
2.Enter the swap parameters:
#Amount to swap
#Recipient address
#Secret hash
#Wallet hashes
3.Generate zero-knowledge proof
4.Execute the private swap

Contract Interface
The main swap contract exposes the following function:

function privateSwap(
    address to,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 wallet_hash_1,
    uint256 wallet_hash_2,
    uint256 secret,
    uint256 nullifier
) external payable;


Testing
The project includes comprehensive test suites:

Smart contract tests using Foundry
Frontend integration tests
ZK circuit tests
Run tests:


# Smart contracts
cd zk_identityswap_foundry
forge test

# Frontend
cd ../zk-identity-ui
npm test


Security
All smart contracts should be properly audited before mainnet deployment
Zero-knowledge proofs ensure transaction privacy
Nullifiers prevent double-spending
